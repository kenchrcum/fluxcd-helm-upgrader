# FluxCD Helm Upgrader - Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and enhancements for the FluxCD Helm Upgrader project. The analysis identified several areas for improvement across security, reliability, observability, testing, and feature completeness.

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. Missing Essential Files
- **Issue**: `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files are referenced in README but don't exist
- **Impact**: Development workflow incomplete, potential security issues
- **Solution**: Create proper `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files

### 2. Inconsistent Image Registry References
- **Issue**: Mixed references between `kenchrcum/fluxcd-helm-upgrader` and `ghcr.io/kenchrcum/fluxcd-helm-upgrader`
- **Impact**: Confusion in deployment, potential pull failures
- **Solution**: Standardize on `ghcr.io/kenchrcum/fluxcd-helm-upgrader` throughout

### 3. Hardcoded GitHub RSA Key
- **Issue**: GitHub's SSH host key is hardcoded in `main.py` (line 308)
- **Impact**: Will break when GitHub rotates keys, security risk
- **Solution**: Implement dynamic key fetching or use SSH keyscan

## üü° High Priority (Should Fix)

### 4. RBAC Security Enhancement
- **Issue**: Cluster-wide RBAC when namespace-scoped might suffice for most use cases
- **Impact**: Over-privileged access, security risk in multi-tenant clusters
- **Solution**: Add option for namespace-scoped RBAC with `rbac.clusterWide: false`

### 5. Health Checks Missing
- **Issue**: No liveness/readiness probes in Kubernetes manifests
- **Impact**: Poor Kubernetes integration, no failure detection
- **Solution**: Add health check endpoints and probes

### 6. Single Point of Failure
- **Issue**: Default single replica configuration
- **Impact**: Service unavailable during pod restarts, rolling updates
- **Solution**: Add `replicaCount` option and HPA support

## üü¢ Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

### 7. Testing Infrastructure
- **Issue**: No test files, CI/CD testing, or validation
- **Impact**: Code quality issues, regressions not caught
- **Solution**:
  - Add unit tests for core functions
  - Add integration tests for Kubernetes operations
  - Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### 8. Monitoring and Observability
- **Issue**: No metrics, monitoring, or alerting
- **Impact**: No visibility into application health or performance
- **Solution**:
  - Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - Implement structured logging
  - Add alerting for failures

### 9. OCI Registry Support
- **Issue**: OCI HelmRepository type detected but not supported
- **Impact**: Limited compatibility with modern Helm repositories
- **Solution**: Implement OCI registry support using `oras` or `helm` CLI

### 10. Configuration Validation
- **Issue**: Limited validation of configuration values
- **Impact**: Runtime failures due to misconfiguration
- **Solution**: Add configuration validation and helpful error messages

## üîµ Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

### 11. Performance Optimizations
- **Issue**: Repository cloning on every run, no caching between runs
- **Impact**: Slower execution, unnecessary network usage
- **Solution**:
  - Implement intelligent caching for repository data
  - Add incremental updates for large repositories

### 12. Advanced Git Operations
- **Issue**: Basic Git operations, no advanced features
- **Impact**: Limited flexibility for complex workflows
- **Solution**:
  - Support for multiple remotes
  - Advanced branch management strategies
  - Git LFS support for large manifests

### 13. Multi-Repository Support
- **Issue**: Single repository scanning only
- **Impact**: Cannot monitor HelmReleases across multiple repositories
- **Solution**: Add support for multiple repository configurations

### 14. Webhook Integration
- **Issue**: No webhook support for external triggers
- **Impact**: Cannot integrate with external CI/CD systems
- **Solution**: Add webhook endpoint for external triggers

### 15. Database Backend
- **Issue**: No persistence, state stored in memory only
- **Impact**: Loss of state on restarts, no history tracking
- **Solution**: Add optional database backend for state persistence

## üìã Implementation Phases

### Phase 2: Security and Reliability (Week 3-4)
1. Implement namespace-scoped RBAC option
2. Add configuration validation
3. Increase default replica count to 2
4. Add resource limits and requests

### Phase 3: Observability and Testing (Week 5-6)
1. Add Prometheus metrics and structured logging
2. Implement comprehensive unit tests
3. Add integration tests for Kubernetes operations
4. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 4: Feature Enhancements (Week 7-8)
1. Implement OCI registry support
2. Add performance optimizations with caching
3. Enhance Git operations with advanced features
4. Add multi-repository support
