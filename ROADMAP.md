# FluxCD Helm Upgrader - Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and enhancements for the FluxCD Helm Upgrader project. The analysis identified several areas for improvement across security, reliability, observability, testing, and feature completeness.

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. Missing Essential Files ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files are referenced in README but don't exist
- **Impact**: Development workflow incomplete, potential security issues
- **Solution**: Create proper `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files

### 2. Inconsistent Image Registry References ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: Mixed references between `kenchrcum/fluxcd-helm-upgrader` and `ghcr.io/kenchrcum/fluxcd-helm-upgrader`
- **Impact**: Confusion in deployment, potential pull failures
- **Solution**: Standardize on `ghcr.io/kenchrcum/fluxcd-helm-upgrader` throughout

### 3. Hardcoded GitHub RSA Key ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: GitHub's SSH host key is hardcoded in `main.py` (line 308)
- **Impact**: Will break when GitHub rotates keys, security risk
- **Solution**: Implement dynamic key fetching or use SSH keyscan

## üü° High Priority (Should Fix)

### 4. RBAC Security Enhancement ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: Cluster-wide RBAC when namespace-scoped might suffice for most use cases
- **Impact**: Over-privileged access, security risk in multi-tenant clusters
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** - Option for namespace-scoped RBAC with `rbac.clusterWide: false`

### 5. Health Checks Missing ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: No liveness/readiness probes in Kubernetes manifests
- **Impact**: Poor Kubernetes integration, no failure detection
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`) and probes

### 6. Single Point of Failure ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Default single replica configuration
- **Impact**: Service unavailable during pod restarts, rolling updates
- **Solution**: **DESIGN DECISION** - Single replica is acceptable for this use case:
  - Application creates GitHub PRs which are manually reviewed and merged
  - Brief downtime during pod restarts is acceptable (seconds to minutes)
  - Avoids complexity of state management, distributed locking, and coordination
  - Resource limits and health checks provide sufficient reliability

## üü¢ Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

### 7. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: No test files, CI/CD testing, or validation
- **Impact**: Code quality issues, regressions not caught
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added comprehensive testing infrastructure:
  - ‚úÖ Unit tests for core functions (config, version parsing, GitHub utils, manifest utils)
  - ‚úÖ Integration tests for Kubernetes operations
  - ‚úÖ Test runner script with coverage reporting
  - ‚úÖ pytest configuration with 80% coverage requirement
  - ‚ùå GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (excluded per request)

### 8. Monitoring and Observability ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: No metrics, monitoring, or alerting
- **Impact**: No visibility into application health or performance
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added comprehensive monitoring and observability:
  - ‚úÖ Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) with detailed metrics
  - ‚úÖ Structured logging with JSON format support
  - ‚úÖ Alerting rules for failures and performance issues
  - ‚úÖ ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule templates for easy integration

### 9. OCI Registry Support ‚ùå **DENIED**
- **Issue**: OCI HelmRepository type detected but not supported
- **Impact**: Limited compatibility with modern Helm repositories
- **Solution**: **DECISION** - Traditional Helm repositories are sufficient for current use cases:
  - Traditional Helm repositories work well with FluxCD
  - No immediate need for OCI registry complexity
  - Focus on core functionality instead of OCI support

### 10. Configuration Validation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: Limited validation of configuration values
- **Impact**: Runtime failures due to misconfiguration
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added comprehensive configuration validation:
  - ‚úÖ Validate required environment variables (REPO_URL or GITHUB_TOKEN)
  - ‚úÖ Validate REPO_URL format (HTTP/HTTPS/SSH)
  - ‚úÖ Validate GITHUB_REPOSITORY format (owner/repo)
  - ‚úÖ Validate SSH key paths and permissions
  - ‚úÖ Validate interval, ports, and directory paths
  - ‚úÖ Validate search pattern format
  - ‚úÖ Helpful error messages with specific guidance
  - ‚úÖ Early validation in main() with graceful exit

## üîµ Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

### 11. Performance Optimizations
- **Issue**: Repository cloning on every run, no caching between runs
- **Impact**: Slower execution, unnecessary network usage
- **Solution**:
  - Implement intelligent caching for repository data
  - Add incremental updates for large repositories

### 12. Advanced Git Operations
- **Issue**: Basic Git operations, no advanced features
- **Impact**: Limited flexibility for complex workflows
- **Solution**:
  - Support for multiple remotes
  - Advanced branch management strategies
  - Git LFS support for large manifests

### 13. Multi-Repository Support
- **Issue**: Single repository scanning only
- **Impact**: Cannot monitor HelmReleases across multiple repositories
- **Solution**: Add support for multiple repository configurations

### 14. Webhook Integration
- **Issue**: No webhook support for external triggers
- **Impact**: Cannot integrate with external CI/CD systems
- **Solution**: Add webhook endpoint for external triggers

### 15. Database Backend
- **Issue**: No persistence, state stored in memory only
- **Impact**: Loss of state on restarts, no history tracking
- **Solution**: Add optional database backend for state persistence
